# BULLS & BEARS

_Keep practicing **jquery** - manipulating buttons, images and text_,<br/>
_using .click() handlers (A function to execute each time the event is triggered)_,<br/>
_together with .show() and .hide() methods for creating animations when the user interacts_.<br/>

## Description

_The Web-page asks the **User** which animal they want to know better_.<br/>
_When a User clicks one of the animal's **button**, it **shows** a description_<br/>
_containing **information** and a **photo** about that selected animal_.<br/>
_When the User later selects a different animal, it **hides** this one_,<br/>
_before **showing** information about another animal_.<br/>
_After that, the User needs to **Refresh** the page to start all over again_.<br/>
_Further development will be implemented_.
